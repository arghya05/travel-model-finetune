## 🎯 **Training Goals System**

### **Goal 1: Travel Quality Score ≥ 7.0**
- Measures travel-specific content quality
- Evaluates practical information
- Tracks Indian traveler context
- Target: 7.0/10.0 (vs ~3.0 base model)

### **Goal 2: Response Length ≥ 300 chars**
- Ensures comprehensive responses
- Prevents cut-off issues from 3B model
- Encourages detailed explanations
- Target: 300+ characters average

### **Goal 3: 100% Base Model Improvement**
- **CRITICAL GOAL**: Must outperform base model
- Tests on comprehensive travel queries
- Tracks improvement ratio per query
- Target: 100% of queries better than base

### **Goal 4: Completion Rate ≥ 95%**
- Ensures responses are complete
- No abrupt endings or errors
- Proper sentence completion
- Target: 95%+ completion rate

### **Goal 5: Template Repetition = 0%**
- Eliminates repetitive templates
- Fixes issues from previous 3B model
- Ensures varied response styles
- Target: 0% template repetition

## 🔍 **Base Model Comparison System**

### **Automatic Testing Every 500 Steps**
```python
# Test queries include:
- Budget travel planning for Indians
- Visa requirements and procedures
- Cultural etiquette and customs
- Food and dietary restrictions
- Emergency procedures abroad
- Luxury and honeymoon destinations
- Solo and adventure travel
- Family travel with children
- Business travel guidance
- Seasonal travel recommendations
```

### **Evaluation Metrics**
- **Quality Score**: 0-10 scale for each response
- **Improvement Ratio**: Fine-tuned score / Base score
- **Success Rate**: % of queries where fine-tuned > base
- **Target**: 100% success rate (all queries better)
