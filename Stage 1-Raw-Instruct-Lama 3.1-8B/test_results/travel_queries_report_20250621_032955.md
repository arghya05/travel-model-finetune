## Query 7: Accommodation

**Question:** What are the pros and cons of staying in hostels vs hotels vs Airbnb for solo travelers?

**Response:**
The main advantage of staying in a hostel is that it’s typically cheaper than a hotel or an Airbnb, and you’ll have the opportunity to meet other people. However, hostels can be noisy, with shared bathrooms and limited amenities. 

Hotels offer more privacy, but they tend to cost more than hostels. They also often provide more amenities such as restaurants and swimming pools.

Airbnb is a great option if you want your own space and flexibility, however prices vary greatly depending on location. You may find yourself paying more than what you would pay at a hotel. Additionally, it doesn’t always guarantee safety, so make sure to read reviews before booking. 

Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and budget. Hostels are great for meeting new people, while hotels and Airbnbs offer more privacy and convenience. All three options offer different advantages and disadvantages, so consider them carefully when deciding where to stay.
